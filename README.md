# chex-game
chex-game ("[the hex board game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_(board_game)) written in C" or "crude hex game" depending on whom you ask) is my first relatively successful attempt at making a playable video game. I wrote it specifically to use the [union-find data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure) as an exercise in applying data structures.

Note that this is not a hex engine (it does not include AI opponents).

## TODO
* swap rule?
* tidy up the code
* etc.
