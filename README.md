# chex-game
chex-game ("[the hex board game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_(board_game)) written in C" or "crude hex game" depending on whom you ask) is my first relatively successful attempt at making a playable video game.

## TODO:
* Add a Makefile
* more description
* Make it more fun and complete.
* etc.
